# Challenge 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## Challenge Description

This challenge is an on-the-job ticket by a hypothetical marketing agency, which requires their site to be optimised for serach engines by making it more accessible. In order to do this, a starter code needs to be refracted (modified and improved without changing what it does) to make it more accessible and meet accessibility standards. Refracting code is one of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. 
 
Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible means they are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.
 
Even though accessibility is a broad topic that can include complex requirements, only a few things will be attempted in this challenge to meet accessibility standards which includes:

* Adding Semantic HTML elements throughout the source code
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title
* Apply **Scout Rule**

## Scout Rule

The **Scout Rule** aims to improve the database for long-term sustainability when a developer is going through someone else's code. For example, making sure that all links are functioning correctly. Also, reworking the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.
